Haskell CStack

CStack implementation written in Haskell

Binaries aren't offered; you must build from source.

## Building from Source

Install [haskell stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/install_and_upgrade/), first.

If you have Makefile, just run `make` in the terminal and it should compile to an executable, also run the executable. If you just want to build
the executable, run `make build`.

If you don't have Makefile:
* Unix-like OS, just run `./project.sh`, and to build it only, just run `./project.sh build`.
* Windows, just run `.\project.bat`, and to build it only, just run `.\project.bat build`.

The shell/batch/make files are supposed to all do the same thing.
